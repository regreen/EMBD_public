# There are 3 folders within this repository: #
# *development*
This folder contains all programs files for the analysis of RNAi conditions (sets of embryos for a given condition), the comparison of those conditions to each other, and the storage and visualization of those data sets in various capacities.

# *embryos_analyze* #
This folder contains program files for the analysis of individual embryos, alignment of embryos, and storage and visualization of data on a per embryo basis.

# *embryo_crop* #
This folder contains all the programs required to crop individual embryos out of a broad field of view. More information on the croping program, which includes a user friendly GUI as well as a more detailed screenCrop.py program, can be found here:
